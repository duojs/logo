Easily include the Duo logo on your site without editing any images. This component is built on the [`logo/logo`](https://github.com/logo/logo) base.

## Usage

```html
<div class="logo" data-logo="Duo" data-color="white">
  <span>Duo</span>
</div>
```

The tags themselves aren't important. Say it was in the header of your site:

```html
<a class="logo" data-logo="Duo">
  <h1>Duo</h1>
</a>
```
